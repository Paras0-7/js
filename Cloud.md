## 5. **What is serverless computing?**
### Explanation:
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. The term "serverless" does not mean that servers are no longer involved; instead, it abstracts the server management away from the developer.

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven:** Functions are executed in response to events (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads).
- **Automatic Scaling:** Automatically scales based on the number of events or requests.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** You are charged only for the compute time you consume, rather than pre-allocating resources.

### Example:
AWS Lambda allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning servers.

## 6. **What is Cloud Security?**
### Explanation:
Cloud security refers to the policies, technologies, and controls that protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure from threats. It includes securing cloud computing environments and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- **Data Protection:** Implementing encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data stored in the cloud.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources and services.
- **Compliance:** Adhering to regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to protect user data and privacy.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitoring for unusual activity and maintaining logs for auditing and troubleshooting.

## 7. **What are the key considerations for cloud migration?**
### Explanation:
Migrating to the cloud involves moving applications, data, and services from on-premises infrastructure to a cloud environment. Key considerations include:

- **Assessment of Current Infrastructure:** Evaluating existing applications and workloads to determine compatibility with cloud services.
- **Choosing the Right Cloud Model:** Deciding between public, private, or hybrid cloud based on organizational needs and compliance requirements.
- **Cost Analysis:** Understanding the cost implications of migration, including potential savings and expenses.
- **Security and Compliance:** Ensuring that data remains secure during and after migration, and meeting regulatory requirements.
- **Migration Strategy:** Developing a detailed plan that outlines the migration process, timeline, and resources needed.
