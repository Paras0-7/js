# Functional Requirements vs. Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific behavior or functions of a system. They describe **what** a system should do. These include tasks, data handling, and the system's functionality in various situations. They are directly related to user actions and how the system responds to those actions.

### Examples of Functional Requirements:
- User authentication and authorization
- Data input and validation
- Generating reports or results based on specific inputs
- Managing a shopping cart in an e-commerce application
- Handling payment processing in an application

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) specify the **quality attributes** of a system. They describe **how** a system should perform. These include performance, security, scalability, and usability. NFRs ensure that the functional requirements are delivered efficiently and effectively.

### Examples of Non-Functional Requirements:
- System response time (performance)
- Data security and encryption (security)
- Availability and reliability (uptime)
- Scalability to handle increased loads (scalability)
- User interface design and accessibility (usability)

## Difference Between Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

| **Aspect**             | **Functional Requirement**                           | **Non-Functional Requirement**                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Defines what the system should do                    | Describes how the system should perform                  |
| **Focus**               | System behavior, tasks, and operations               | Quality, performance, and user experience                |
| **Example**             | Logging into a system using username and password    | The system should load within 2 seconds                  |
| **Importance**          | Directly related to business logic and functionality | Affects system performance, scalability, and usability   |
| **Testability**         | Easier to test through functional testing            | Requires special testing, like performance or security tests |
| **User Impact**         | Determines if the system meets user needs            | Impacts user satisfaction and overall experience         |

In summary, functional requirements focus on the **actions** a system must perform, while non-functional requirements focus on the **quality attributes** that ensure the system performs those actions effectively.
